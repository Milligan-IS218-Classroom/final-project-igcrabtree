                    <p>Growing up, I was always good at math and solving puzzles. I loved learning new things at school, but I also enjoyed 
                        arts and crafts as a way to express my creative side. I was introduced to coding in middle school and loved that it 
                        required constant learning and problem solving, that it implemented math, and that it allowed for creativity. This 
                        encouraged me to pursue computer science and information systems at Milligan University, where I am also a member of 
                        the women’s basketball team. College athletics has allowed me a great opportunity to learn how to manage my time well, 
                        how to be a leader even when I’m not the most skilled, and how to be patient in a rapidly evolving environment where 
                        mistakes happen frequently. On top of my studies and basketball, I also intern at Streamworks Education, a non-profit 
                        that encourages children in the community to participate in STEM extracurricular activities. At Streamworks, I enjoy 
                        getting to develop a diverse skill set. Through planning out a robotics competition with other interns, developing a 
                        complex web app for scoring the competition, and working with many children at once, I have been able to learn effective 
                        communication and teamwork skills, expand my knowledge and experience in programming, as well as how to adapt quickly in 
                        a fast paced environment. You never know what you might get with kids, so I have learned to always be prepared for 
                        challenging and adverse situations. I recently began my journey as a barista at Starbucks too. I am really enjoying this, 
                        as I love coffee and meeting all the other people that love it as well. Communicating effectively with coworkers and customers, 
                        while continuing to pay attention to the details of crafting a personalized coffee, is a sometimes challenge, but a beneficial 
                        one that I enjoy. I hope to use the skills I have learned to excel as a software engineer. I am excited for this next step in 
                        my life and for the eventual opportunity to work in an environment that requires constant learning and adaptation.</p>
